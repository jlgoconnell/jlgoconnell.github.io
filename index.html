  <p>Hi, I'm James, an engineer based in Adelaide, Australia. I graduated in 2022 with a PhD in engineering, and have significant interests in control theory & estimation, electromagnetism, computing, and digital signal processing.</p>
  <p>This website describes a little about my engineering experience and qualifications. I've done some interesting projects both professionally and just for fun, and some are detailed on my <a href="./projects.html">Projects</a> page. While I don't yet have a long career, some of my professional achievements are given on my <a href="./professional.html">Professional</a> page. Lastly, a copy of my thesis is available <a href="./thesis/thesis.pdf">here</a>, with a more brief description on my <a href="./education.html">Education</a> page.</p>
  <p>Thank you for taking the time to visit my page.</p>
